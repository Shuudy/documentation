# About this tools directory

Here we'll save the "preview" screenshots of each tools documented. 

The name of the files is important and is based on the generated 
name from the cPanel sprite system.

cPanel will generate a sprite of all the tools icons. Each tool will 
have a css class that looks like this : .icon-imunify_antivirus. 

Here, the preview image associated with the "imunify" tools must be called : imunify-antivirus.png
